                    <h2>Individual Game Platformer</h2>

                    <p>
                        This artifact is based in Unity and was created for GIMM 100. It is a semi-collectathon platformer that focuses on Ninjas. You are the blue ninja who has to save the world from the red ninja by collecting sigils through the levels.

                    <h2>360 Unity Experience</h2>

                    <p>
                        This artifact was for GIMM 270.
                         During the course of this project I learned how to make a video display in unity as a skybox
                          and incidentally how to convert dual fisheye to an equirectangular format in a roundabout
                           way using Adobe After Effects due to a bug in the output of our 360 camera.  
                           This project was a group project that was mostly my doing. 
                           It was NOT fun because I had not included an  OVR Camera rig which is what makes 
                           the program even work with the oculus VR in the first place.

                    <h2>AR Game Project</h2>

                    <p>
                        This artifact is about integrating AR applications into Unity and potentially 
                         making AR projects for the purpose of education.
                         I pitched the idea behind this project, it was going to be about a mushroom man saving his world.
                         It had the potential to be integrated into Biology teacher classrooms because the AR markers were going to be educational cards about various types of mushrooms. 
                         I learned how to set up an AR webcam system in Unity that is able to track image targets 
                         and my modified specialty code enabled and disabled objects using this for various gameplay changes. 
                         I also learned how to make mock storyboards for the project. 
                         What made this project fun to build for the portions of 
                         it I was responsible for was working with the cool Vuforia technology. 
                         I felt really accomplished when I got the AR up and running exactly how I wanted 
                         it with an extra timer feature that scans the AR markers and then puts them on cooldown.
